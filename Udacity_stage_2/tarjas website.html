            <p>After the first unit we are familiar with concepts such the web, html, urls and web applications. We know how I, my computer (browser), the internet, http and servers are connected to each other. We are also familiar with  basic html markups. We have learned how to edit text and how to add images and urls to our website.
            </P>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
              <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>is made of text content (what you see)</li>
				          <li>markup (what it looks like)</li>
                  <li>references to other documents (for example images and videos)</li>
                  <li>links to other pages</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>HTML markup</h3>				          
              <p>One element consists of an opening tag, contents and a closing tag.
		          </p>
            <h3>HTML attribute</h3>
              <p>consists of tag attr=value, contents and closing tag. A good example is a <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Add-a-Hyperlink-with-HTML">hyperlink</a>.
              </p>
            <h3>Images</h3>
              <div class=image>     
              	 <img src="http://image.shutterstock.com/display_pic_with_logo/283048/283048,1284913689,1/stock-photo-very-happy-black-dog-sitting-on-green-grass-61283164.jpg." alt="happy black dog sitting on a grass">
              </div>
  		        <p>Images don't have closing tag.
  		            </p>
            <h3>White space</h3>
              <p>Text can be folded in multiple lines with break and paragraph tags.
 	            </p>
            <h3>Inline vs.block</h3>
              <p>br, img, span and a are inline elements. p, div are block elements.
              </p>
          </div>

            <p>Web pages are constructed of boxes. HTML provides the structure to the website and CSS it`s style. Javascript provides interaction to the site. We are familiar with the concepts such as DOM (document object model) which provides the tree-like structure of the website. We also know that developers boxify their design. 
            </P>
            <h3>Html, CSS and Javascript</h3>
              <p>Html, CSS and Javascript are all languages. Html defines the structure of your document, CSS it`s style (how the page looks like) and Javascript it`s functionalities.
              </p>
            <h3>Boxes and Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
              <p>All elements on the website are boxes and each website has a tree like structure (DOM). The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. This relationship can be compared to a family tree. In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. hen you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.
              </p>
            <h3>Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
              <p>Writing code is easier with the special text editor such as Sublime. Text editors predict the tags we might want to use from the first letter and add a closing tag automatically.
              </p>
            <h3>CSS language</h3>
              <p>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It allows programmers to avoid repetition. Order matters in CSS and most specific rule applies. Rules can be defined in different places and are applied in the following order: definitions further down on the list overwrite previous ones.
              </p>
            <h3>Code, test, refine</h3>
              <p>Look for natural boxes, repeated styles and semantic elements. Then write your html. Apply the styles from biggest to smallest. Fix things.
              </p>
            <h3>Developer tools</h3>
              <p>Developer tools allow us to test changes without applying them to html. They help us to compare our code with the design mock-up. We can compare margins, color etc.
              </p>  
            <h3>Validate your code</h3>
              <p>Verify your html and css with the validator tools.<br>To verify HTML: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input">http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input</a><br>

          <div class="content-title">
          New concepts
          </div>
          <div class="content-description">
            <p>After the first session of stage 2 we are familiar with the concepts such as programming languages, interpreter, Python, grammar and Python expressions. I also know that my computer is fast in processing cycles. Cycle is a time computer has to do one step. My computer does 2,7 billion cycles per second. One step 2.7 billion times/second. In the time my computer does a cycle, light travels 11.1cm.
              </P>
            <h3>Computer, program and programming</h3>
              <p>These concepts are core of computer science. Computer is a universal machine and program will tell it what to do. It can be changed into anything imaginable by giving it step-by-step instructions i.e. writing a program. Program is very precise sequence of steps that computer needs to take in order to serve as an internet browser, server, game playing   machine etc. It can do computations in a very short amount of time.
              </p>
            <h3>Programming language, Python and interpreter</h3>
              <p>We need programming languages because instructions to computers have to be clear and precise. Natural languages ambiguity and verbosity make the use of them in programming cumbersome. Natural languages can be interpreted in many ways and and instructions would get verylengthy. There are many <em>programming languages</em>, and at this course we will learn Python, a high level programming language. Instead of the program running directly on our computer, the program we`ll write will be input to the Python program that will run on our machine. Python is an <em>interpreter: it runs our programs, interprets them and executes them in a language that computer understands.</em>
              </p>
            <h3>Grammar</h3>
              <p>Python has a grammar like natural languages do. It defines what strings are in the language and what is correct and   what incorrect. 
              </p>
            <h3>Python expressions</h3>
              <p>A Python "expression" is a legal Python statement. Expression has to be exact in order it to be correct. 
              </p>
            <h3>Variables and strings</h3>
              <p>Variables offer a means to name values. We can assign a value to a variable by adding equal sign between them. In this case equal sign means "takes the value of" unlike in an expression 2+3=5 where it means "is the same as". Variables improve code readability, provide us a way to store the value of data and change to value of something. 
              </p>
              <p>Strings are separated from numbers by adding "" aroud them. for example "3" is read by Python as text string and 3 as number. Code 3+3 and "3"+"3" will therefore give different results. The code 3+3 would give 6 and code "3"+"3" would give "33". Find function is an efficient way to find strings in a flow of strings. Adding a place into a find function allows us to search the text after the strings we have already found.</p>
            <h3>Input, function, output</h3>
              <p>Function takes input and produces output, for example sum procedure takes numbers (or strings) as input and adds them together. Functions are made of def statement followed by the parameters in parantheses. The parameters will be replaced by values when the function is used. To use the function we give the name of it followed my the value in parantheses.
              </p>
              <p>Return statement in Python is an "action code": it tells Python exactly what to do to produce output. Without return statement interpreter will get confused and will not know what it should do.
              </p>

            <h3>If and while statements, break and or</h3>
              <p>If statement is used for conditionl execution. It evaluates the expressions one by one until one is found to be true. If false, the program moves to the next statement. While statement is used to create loops, repeated execution, which goes on as long as expression is true.
              </p>
              <p>Break statement gives a way to stop the loop.</p>
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
              <p>Debugging is essential in software engineering. Sometimes our program does not work and we have to find out why.
                <ul>
                  <li>Examine the error message - start from the last line.</li>
                  <li>Work from example code.</li>
                  <li>Make sure examples work. Sometimes they are great, but sometimes they might not be so good.</li>
                  <li>Check intermediate results by adding print statement in the middle of your code.</li>
                  <li>Keep and compare old versiosn for review.</li>
                </ul>
            <H3>Structural data: lists and For loops</H3>
              <p>List is a new way to store data in a more structured object. As strings are sequences of characters, lists can be sequences of anything:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lists can contain strings, for example p=['apple','raspberry','blackberry'].</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain numbers, for example p=[0,0,7].</li>
                  <li>Lists can be 'accessed' and 'sliced' just like strings.</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain strings and numbers, for example ['spy',0,0,7,'bond'].</li>
                  <li>Lists can contain other lists, for example ['a','b',[0,1,7]].</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Mutation and aliasing</h3>
              <p>Lists support mutation, which means that any member of the list can be replaced by something else. Strings in contrary are immutable.</p>
            <h3>More list operations: append, + and len</h3>
              <p>Append is a method, which mutates the old list. It adds an element at the end of the list. It's structure is the following: list.append (element).
              <br>+ adds the two lists together like this [0,1] + [2,3] --> [0,1,2,3].
              <br>Len operators output tells the number of the elements in a list.</p>
